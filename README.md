# albuMPL-palette
Custom matplotlib color palettes based on album covers. New default color cycles and colormaps are stored in style files for easy access.

The options are as follows:
1. __LondonCalling__ inspired by The Clash - _London Calling_ (which ***technically*** means it was inspired by Elvis Presley's eponymous album)
