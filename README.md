# albuMPL-palette
Custom matplotlib color palettes based on album covers. New default color cycles and colormaps are stored in style sheets for easy access.

The options (to now) are:
1. __LondonCalling__ inspired by The Clash - _London Calling_ (which, of course, ***technically*** means it was inspired by Elvis Presley's eponymous album)
